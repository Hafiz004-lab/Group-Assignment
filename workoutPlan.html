					<p>It can be difficult to find time for exercise due to other obligations. Don’t let a busy schedule stop you; exercise can be done in ten minute increments if you can’t set aside larger chunks of time. Once you find the time, you need only decide where and how you will work out. Alternate your routines and be mindful of what you’re eating and drinking as well.</p>
					<b><p>1. Finding a Time and Place</p></b>
                    
                    <div class="blog-image wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.9s">

					<blockquote>
						 Know what times you have available and commit to those times. Write down the amount of time you have and what days you're planning on exercising. Share your schedule with your friends and family and put the schedule up on your wall. You're more likely to commit when you have accountability.
					</blockquote>
					<p>You may be, or become, a member at a local gym. If not, you may decide to workout at home. You can even exercise outdoors; walking or running on a path near your office may be the best fit for you. Alternating between these options will work as well, don’t feel as though you always have to exercise in the same place.</p>

                                        <p> At the same time, if you know you’re too tired after work to do anything other than lay on the couch, try to schedule your workouts for earlier in the day.</p>

					<blockquote>
						 Learning the basics of working out is an essential first step in building a foundation for a successful fitness journey. Understanding the fundamentals not only helps you avoid injuries but also allows you to make consistent progress toward your fitness goals.
					</blockquote>
					<p>
Do some push-ups. This exercise engages the front of your body in the arm and chest area. Start in a high plank position with your palms flat on the ground underneath your shoulders. While keeping your back straight, lower your body and then raise your body by bending at the elbow.</p>
                                        <p>Try sit-ups. Strengthen your abdominal muscles with sit-ups.</p>
                                        <p>
Try squats. This exercise works your lower body.</P>

					<blockquote>
						
Start with a full-body workout. Experts recommend beginners start with a full-body routine two to three times per week. This will help you get in shape and get ready to move on to more challenging or centralized workouts.					</blockquote>
					<p>Find a trainer to help you get started.</p>
                                        <p>
Pick your equipment. If you decide to exercise at a gym, they will likely have everything you need.</p>
                                        <p>
Choose the exercises that are right for you. Many websites offer exercise regimens and step-by-step instructions. Check out Thenx App for a wide variety of routines</p>
                                        <p>
Do cardio. Cardiovascular exercise gets your heart rate up. This is best if you want to slim down. Cardio exercises include aerobics, running, dancing, and using the treadmill. Do about 1.5-2 hours of cardio exercises each week.</p>
<br>

					<blockquote>
						It's normal to face challenges during workouts, especially if you're a beginner or have a unique body shape. Everyone has different fitness levels, so don't hesitate to adjust your workout depending on where you're at. If you're starting, it's a good idea to begin with simple exercises to learn the correct form before moving on to more challenging variations. Choosing exercises that suit your body helps you to achieve your fitness goals safely and effectively.
					</blockquote>
					<p>
Build your tolerance. Most exercises are a single movement that you do multiple times. Different numbers of repetitions (reps) give you different results. Build endurance and tone by doing 12 or more reps with 2-3 or more sets using light weight, build muscle size and strength by doing 8-12 reps in sets of 3-4 with moderate to heavy weight, and build muscle strength by doing 5-8 reps or 5-6 sets with super heavy weight.</p>

					<blockquote>
						
Drink water. It’s incredibly important to stay hydrated while exercising. This is particularly true if you work out outdoors, especially in the hot summer months. Water is the best way to keep hydrated. You could consider sports drinks as well, but pay attention to the ingredients: many are full of sugar and sodium.
					</blockquote>
					<p>
Eat healthy. You won’t see much improvement from your exercise if you are constantly eating junk food.</p>
                                        <p>
Consider supplements. It’s important to do your research and find out what ingredients are in your supplements, and if they will truly benefit you. Look for products with carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and essential amino acids. </p>

					<blockquote>
						
Rest. Not only do you want to take a short break between sets, but you should also rest between workouts. Your muscles need time to rest, and you actually build muscle during those breaks. Aim for 24-48 hours of rest between workouts.
					</blockquote>
					<p> During a workout, especially strength training, you create tiny tears in muscle fibers. Rest allows these fibers to repair and grow back stronger, a process known as muscle hypertrophy.</p>
                                        <p>Overtraining occurs when the body doesn’t have enough time to recover between workouts, which can lead to fatigue, weakened immune function, and increased injury risk.</p>
